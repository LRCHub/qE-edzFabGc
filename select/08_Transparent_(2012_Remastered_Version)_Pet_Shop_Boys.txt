Straight in the eyes
I won't let you leave over my dead body
Maybe yours too

Oh
You wrote down every lie
Oh

Pretty
Perfect
Girly
Dressed in black
Purple highlights in the back

I see you as you are
I see you're transparent
I see you as you are

Thinking your ass is as good as it gets

I see you as you are
I see you're transparent
I see you as you are

I just saw you twitch

Pretending to play dead
In this kitty's house
So, i'll toy with you
So try not to be caught

And my tempers high

Oh
You wrote down every lie
Oh

Pretty
Perfect
Girly
Dressed in black
Purple highlights in the back

I see you as you are
I see you're transparent
I see you as you are
I see you're transparent

Thinking your ass is as good as it gets

I see you as you are
I see you're transparent
I see you as you are
I see you're transparent

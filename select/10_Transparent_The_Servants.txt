Squid on my stomach exploding fat
Lying on my belly pretending that
I was a whale

Washed up on the shore in a sea blue coat
And a silken streamline pink and mauve
I drank from the grail

Don't turn your eyes
Away from the window
It's a see-through disguise
On the pillow

The eye looked down as a hulking mass
Spawned by the linger of floating gas
That clings to the lungs

Close up all light with a curtain tug
Follow the trail of the ceiling bug
And entwining tongues

Don't turn your eyes
Away from the window
It's a see-through disguise
On the pillow

Dark eyes stare from the same place where
My head was bared in the icy prayer of nightmare
Call up small to a tiny ball
Or out to the hall, to the staircase fall
Hear a distant call

The size of the bird was an ocean squid
I understood it secretly shared between

Me and the wall and the record and you
One and all grown askew
But there's you and the ten or two i've seen

Cream in the ashtray
I take back the pictures to my dark hideaway
